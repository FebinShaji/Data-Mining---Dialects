# Data-Mining---Dialects

The purpose of this project is to choose a language and make use of data collection to collate a corpus of the different dialects of that language. The different dialects will be stored in seperate corpra and then we will make use of code that we develop, in order to clear up the corpus and then combine them. After we achieve this we can analyse the corpus using text analytics.

this exercise will enable me to
- Investigate theory, methods and terminology used in Data Mining and Text Analytics;
- Experience how to apply algorithms, resources and techniques for implementing and evaluating
Data Mining and Text Analytics in a practical research exercise;
- Summarise and present your achievements to a peer audience, in a research conference paper.

In my research conference paper, I will assess:
- Business Understanding: state objectives & requirements, and data mining problem definition
- Data Understanding: explain data collection process, data quality issues
- Data Preparation: how the data was converted for mining and analysis tools
- Modelling: features and classifiers investigated, with example outputs
- Evaluation: evaluation methods, tables of results, best features and classifiers
- References; include at least 4 references by Leeds University researchers
- Format: conforming to ACL paper format and organisation
